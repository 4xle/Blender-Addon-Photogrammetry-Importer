### Reconstruction Representation with Blender Objects

The point point cloud is represented with two objects.
* One object associated with a particle system, which represents the structure of the point cloud. 
* One object that defines the shape of the particles.

The color of the particles is defined by a single material as shown in the image below.

Note: The second input "Value" in the "Divide" node represents the number of particles in the point cloud.
