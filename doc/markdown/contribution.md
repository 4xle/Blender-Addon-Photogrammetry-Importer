## Contribution
I am always happy to get advices as well as feature and pull requests. 
If you want to create a pull request I recommend to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with this [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JacquesLucke.blender-development). 
This allows to perform fast development and validation cycles with Blender scripts and Addons. 
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q06-hER7Y1Q) is an introduction / tutorial video.
