### Adjust Scale of Points (after importing)
For each imported point cloud two objects are created. The first object represents the structure of the point cloud and the second object defines the shape of the points in the point cloud. Rescaling of the second object will also update the size of the points in the point cloud.

### Adjust Scale of Cameras (after importing) 
Select the cameras, click in the *3D View* on *Pivot Point* and then on *Individual Origins*. Subsequent scaling operations with *Individual Origins* will only change the camera appearances but not the positions.
